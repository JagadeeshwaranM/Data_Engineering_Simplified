Compute forms the nucleus of creating and executing business.

AWS provides several compute products that allows to deploy, run, and scale applications as virtual servers, code, or containers.

Compute Covers

	• Simple websites and applications on one or a few servers
	• Control and manage cluster or server level functions such as deployment and scaling
	• Manage stateful or stateless applications packaged as Docker containers
	• Stateless, event-initiated applications that require fast response times

Different Compute services offered by AWS.

	• Amazon EC2 - Virtual Servers in the Cloud
	• Amazon EC2 Container Service - Run and Manage Docker Containers
	• AWS Lambda - Run Code in Response to Events
	• Amazon EC2 Container Registry - Store and Retrieve Docker Images
	• Amazon Lightsail - Launch and Manage Virtual Private Servers
	• Amazon VPC - Isolated Cloud Resources
	• AWS Batch - Run Batch Jobs at Any Scale
	• AWS Elastic Beanstalk - Run and Manage Web Apps
	• Auto Scaling - Automatic Elasticity

**Amazon EC2**
offers resizable cloud-based compute capability taking shape as virtual servers. 
There are a broad range of instance types that are easily manageable and exhibit different combinations of networking capacity, storage size, amount of memory, and CPU power.

Features

	• Removes the necessity of upfront investment on computer hardwares.
	• Commission numerous instances simultaneously
	• Pay only for the used quantity
	• Change web-scale cloud computing easy
  
Applications

	• Big data - e.g. Hadoop
	• Database software - e.g. Aurora, DynamoDB
	• Enterprise applications - e.g. SAP, Oracle
	• Migrations from on-premises environments
	• Open-source cluster management

**Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)**

Amazon ECS is a scalable, performance container management service to include Docker containers. 
It enables you to run applications at ease on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
Amazon ECS removes the necessity to install, run, and scale cluster management infrastructure.

Applications
	• Web applications
	• Microservices
	• Batch jobs
	• Docker workloads

**AWS Lambda**

AWS Lambda aims to run code without managing or provisioning servers.

	• Lambda is the nucleus of serverless computing. So build and run services and applications without bothering about servers.
	• Run code for virtually any type of backend service or application - with no administration.
	• Upload the code and Lambda handles everything needed to run and scale the code with better availability.
	• Pay only for the compute time that you use.
	• Create code to automatically trigger from other AWS services, otherwise call it directly from a mobile or web app.
  
Applications

	• Web applications
	• Mobile backends
	• IoT backends
	• Stream processing workloads and File processing workloads
