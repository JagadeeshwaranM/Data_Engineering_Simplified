Kafka is a unique distributed publish-subscribe messaging system written in the Scala language with multi-language support and 
runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


Kafka has high-throughput and is built to scale-out in a distributed model on multiple servers.

Kafka persists messages on disk and can be used for batched consumption as well as real time applications.
